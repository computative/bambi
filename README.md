This repository contains a python script (optimised in cython) that implements the algorithm of 
Max, N. & Weinkauf, T. Critical Points of the Electric Field from a Collection of Point Charges. 
in Topology-Based Methods in Visualization  II vol. 2 101â€“114 (Springer, 2009).

The scripts runs on python 3 (untested on python 2.7) using numpy and optional plotting in 
matplotlib. For ~120x speedup consider using the cython version, in which case cython and 
compiler is required. 

The script is provided without any warranties or guarantees whatsoever. Use at your own risk.
